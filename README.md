## YouTube Channel Scraper

A Python script that retrieves **video titles, URLs, and view counts** from specified YouTube channels using the **YouTube Data API v3**.

It fetches all videos from each channel’s *Uploads playlist*, collects statistics, and saves the results into separate CSV files — one per channel.
